###Why would I use pre-compiled CSS?
Pre-compiled CSS seems to make life *much* easier. It can be a hassle to get things up and running at first but afterwards it all works seamlessly smooth.

The fact that you can use variables in the CSS-code should be more than enough to get you excited. Variables can be used to assign a hex-number to an easy-to-remember variable name. Nesting gives us a good way to structure the code and also easier to read and maintain.

####<span style="color:red">-</span> Cons
