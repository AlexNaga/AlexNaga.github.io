###Why robots.txt?
Robots.txt allows the developer to set specific settings on how search engines should handle and index the website into their database. It can restrict crawling where it's not needed.

This is **_not_** a way of securing sensitive data from being accessible, other crawlers might not obey these instructions. Therefore it's better to use other blocking methods such as password protecting files on the server.
