###Static Site Generators
SSG (Static Site Generators) are great for building a simple website without the need of using a database. Instead of editing multiple files whenever you need to change something, like a meny. You can build an easy framework and let the generator create the HTML-files, process the posts and pages for you. This is perfect for smaller projects.

I have used a SSG before and I must say it's a really useful tool once you know how to use it.
