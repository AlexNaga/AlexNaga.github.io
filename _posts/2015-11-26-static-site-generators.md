###Static Site Generators
SSGs are great for building a simple website without the need of using a database. Instead of repeating lots of HTML-code you build an easy framework and let the generator process the posts and pages for you. Mostly suitable for smaller projects.

I have used a SSG before and I must say it's a really useful tool once you know how to use it.
