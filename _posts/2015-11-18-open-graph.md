###What is Open Graph?
I've always found it interesting when pasting a link in Facebook that it fetches the information about the link almost instatly, before I hit the send button.
Wondering how Facebook did it; maybe using a fancy web scraper?

So after some time Facebook and some other social media companies created a protocol allowing easy sharing the contect on social media sites.

So today we have [Open Graph](http://www.ogp.me) and the world is a better place!

###Using Open Graph
Open Graph is a protocol used for easy sharing on social media. It creates a more presentable view of your site, showing the information that you added to the meta-tags.
