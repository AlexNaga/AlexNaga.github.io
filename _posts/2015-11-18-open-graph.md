###What is Open Graph?
I've always found it interesting when pasting a link in Facebook that it fetches the information about the link almost instatly, before I hit the send button.
Wondering how Facebook did it; maybe using a fancy web scraper?

So after some time Facebook and some other social media companies created a protocol allowing easy sharing the contect on social media sites.

So today we have [Open Graph](http://www.ogp.me) and the world is a better place!

###Adding Open Graph Tags
Open Graph is a protocol used for easy sharing on social media. It creates a more presentable view of your site. More simply, add **Open Graph meta tags** to your website to have greater control how your content is displayed when shared via social media.

####This is my meta tags
`<meta property="og:title" content="Alex Naga - 1DV022">`

`<meta property="og:type" content="website">`

`<meta property="og:description" content="This website is created for the course 1DV022 at Linnaeus University">`

`<meta property="og:url" content="an222zd.github.io">`
